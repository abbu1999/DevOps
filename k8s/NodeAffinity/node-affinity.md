# üñ•Ô∏è Kubernetes Node Affinity Guide

## üìå What is Node Affinity?

**Node Affinity** in Kubernetes is a set of rules that influence **which nodes a Pod can be scheduled on**, based on **node labels**.  
It works like `nodeSelector` but is **more expressive and flexible**.

- **Taints/Tolerations** ‚Üí decide *which Pods can be blocked or allowed* on a node.  
- **Node Affinity** ‚Üí decides *where a Pod prefers or requires to run*.  

---

## üîé Checking & Managing Node Labels

1. **Check Node Labels**  
```bash
kubectl describe node node01
Add a Label to a Node

bash
Copy code
kubectl label node node01 size=Large
Remove a Label from a Node

bash
Copy code
kubectl label node node01 size-
‚öôÔ∏è Types of Node Affinity
Node affinity rules are always defined under:

yaml
Copy code
spec.affinity.nodeAffinity
1Ô∏è‚É£ requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
During Scheduling: Pod must be scheduled only on nodes with matching labels.

Ignored During Execution: If labels are later removed, the Pod continues to run (not evicted).

‚úÖ Example use: strict rules (e.g., "Only run on SSD nodes").

2Ô∏è‚É£ preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
During Scheduling: Scheduler prefers matching nodes.

If available ‚Üí schedules on them.

If not ‚Üí can fall back to other nodes.

Ignored During Execution: If labels are later removed, Pod continues running.

‚úÖ Example use: soft preference (e.g., "Prefer GPU nodes, but run elsewhere if not available").

3Ô∏è‚É£ requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution (‚ùórarely used)
During Scheduling: Pod must match node labels.

During Execution: If labels change and no longer match, the Pod will be evicted automatically.

‚úÖ Example use: very strict enforcement (less common in production due to evictions).

üîë Match Expressions
Node affinity uses matchExpressions with:

key ‚Üí node label key

operator ‚Üí how to match (In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Gt, Lt)

values ‚Üí acceptable values for the key

üìÇ Example Pod with Node Affinity
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-process
      image: nginx
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: size
                operator: In
                values:
                  - Large
üîé Explanation:
key: size ‚Üí looks for the node label size

operator: In ‚Üí node must have label size with one of the listed values

values: Large ‚Üí only nodes labeled size=Large qualify

If no node has size=Large, Pod stays Pending.

‚úÖ Summary
Node Affinity ‚Üí controls where Pods can be scheduled using labels.

Use kubectl label to manage node labels.

Types:

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution ‚Üí strict at scheduling, ignored later.

preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution ‚Üí soft rule, fallback allowed.

requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution ‚Üí strict at scheduling and runtime (evicts if violated).

More powerful and flexible than nodeSelector.

‚úÖ This version fixes your YAML (`operator: In` instead of `Equal`), adds explanations for **operators**, and covers all affinity types.
